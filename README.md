This fish is still focused on Minecraft, which is her favorite game. But she's really really lazy so there will not be much thing there :P
 	 	       	  	     	 	      	      	     
If you want to know more about the fish, you need to ask her by yourself.
	   	 	     	     	       	      	      	 	  
She always hopes that there is no bug on her code, but there always is. So she always hates bugs, not only in code but also in real life.
